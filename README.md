# ChatBox
Client-Server Messaging Application written in Python (server side) and JavaScript (client side) with the use of websockets for sending/receiving messages and SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL) for storing/handling the database.

The chat rooms can be created and accessed in the browser (http://77.255.187.145:13297/). No installation and no registration needed.

The chats are open and can be viewed by all the users who enter them.
